# portfolio

The starting point of my Web Development career. I have recently graduated from college and I am excited to begin getting into the real world. One of the important first steps would be to get some Git experience, so this portfolio will (hopefully!) showcase what I have learnt so far, as well as any projects I am currently working on. 

This repository will be focusing mainly on HTML/CSS/JS and ASP.NET MVC.

Thanks for reading,
Take Care!

Mike
